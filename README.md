👋 Hi, I’m Leandro Camilotti
👀 I’m interested to have a chance as web developer Junior, I have some backgroung in code since 2006 using pascal, Qbasic, Visual Basic and C++,
but I never worked with it in the past, I have always worked on the server side, like windows server and computer network and field engineer.
Now I am back to learning and update my skills on this code world and I hope in the future I can get my first job as web developer.
🌱 I’m currently learning  HTML, CSS and JavaScript, React, Redux, Firebase, Node.Js.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new projects and learning from it to became a senior in the future and leave my mark on the company who will help me get there.
