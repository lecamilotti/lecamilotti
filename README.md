👋 Hi, I’m Leandro Camilotti
👀 I'm a passionate and ambitious web developer who believes that web applications make a positive impact in people's life. I am always proactively learning new ways to build my skill set and add tools that will compliment those skills. I´m currently on a Code BootCamp building my experience with own projects using tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, TypeScript, styled components, express, and Node.js.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new projects and learning from it and leave my mark on the company who will help me get there.
📫 You can reach me on my Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/leandrocamilotti/
